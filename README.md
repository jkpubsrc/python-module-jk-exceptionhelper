jk_exceptionhelper
==================

Introduction
------------

This python module provides a way to model python exceptions in a clean object oriented way. It is then easy to work with these exception objects.

Information about this module can be found here:

* [github.org](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-exceptionhelper)
* [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jk_exceptionhelper)

Why this module?
----------------

Though the python exception API has improved over time it still is quite complex and a bit confusing because of its complexity. This module tries to solve this problem by modeling exceptions in a very defined, clean, object oriented way similar to other programming languages such as Java, C# and others.

How to use this module
----------------------

### Import this module

Please include this module into your application using the following code:

```python
import jk_exceptionhelper
```

### Analyse the exeption

Example:

```python
try:
	a = 0
	b = 5 / a
except Exception as ex:
	ee = ExceptionObject.fromException(ex)
```

Now `ee` contains an instance of `ExceptionObject`. `ExceptionObject` contains all relevant information from the exception for your convenience to work with.

### Output the exception data

For testing or debugging there is an easy way to write all exception data to STDOUT:

Example:

```python
try:
	a = 0
	b = 5 / a
except Exception as ex:
	ee = ExceptionObject.fromException(ex)
	ee.dump()
```

This will print the following lines to STDOUT:

```
ZeroDivisionError
: exceptionTextHR:
:       division by zero
: stackTrace:
:       ./example_simple.py:18 :: 'b = 5 / a'
\-
```

### Nested exeptions

Example:

```python
try:
	try:
		... do something that fails ...
	except Exception as e2:
		raise Exception("Something has failed!", ExceptionObject.fromException(e2))

except Exception as e:
	ee = ExceptionObject.fromException(e)
	ee.dump()
```

Now `ee` contains an instance of `ExceptionObject`. `ExceptionObject` itself contains not only standard exception data but a reference to the nested `ExceptionObject`.
The trick is here to get a model of the original exception immediately so that the current stack trace is captured. Then a new exception can be raised.
If at a later step `ExceptionObject.fromException(...)` is invoked again, the method `fromException()` will automatically find the appended `ExceptionObject` and
use it as a nested exception.

API: Classes
------------

## Class 'ExceptionObject'

### Fields

| Type	| Name	| Required?	| Description	|
| ----- | ----- | --------- | ------------- |
| `class`				| `exceptionClass`		| optional	| The original exception class. This instance will only be present if `analyseException()` was called within an `except` block.	|
| `str`					| `exceptionClassName`	| required	| The class name of the exception.														|
| `str`					| `exceptionTextHR`		| optional	| A human readable text that was contained within the exception.						|
| `StackTraceItem[]`	| `stackTrace`			| optional	| The stack trace. The last item of the list is the topmost stack element.				|
| `ExceptionObject`		| `nestedException`		| optional	| Another exception object the current exception could refer to if it replaces the other exception.	|

### Static Methods

#### Static Method `StackTraceItem fromJSON(dict data)`

`StackTraceItem fromJSON(dict data)`

Deserialize a data structure created by `toJSON()`.

#### Static Method `ExceptionObject fromException(BaseException exception)`

`ExceptionObject fromException(BaseException exception)`

Capture all python exception information and represent it as `ExceptionObject` for later processing.

### Methods

#### Method `void dump()`

`void dump()`

Print the contents of the exception to STDOUT.

#### Method `dict toJSON(bool bRecursive = True)`

`dict toJSON(bool bRecursive = True)`

Serialize the exception object to JSON format.

Arguments:

* `bool bRecursive` : If `True` (which is the default) nested exceptions are serialized as well. If `False` these get skipped.

Example:

```python
try:
	a = 0
	b = 5 / a
except Exception as ex:
	ee = ExceptionObject.fromException(ex)
	edata = ee.toJSON()
```

#### Method `dict toJSON_flat()`

`dict toJSON_flat()`

Same as `toJSON(False)`.

Arguments:

* (none)
